# What is the difference between Statically typed and Dynamically typed?

Ans:(1).Statically type:Statically typed programming languages do type checking at compile-time.
                          Example:C,C++,Java,Rust,Scala etc..,
        
     (2).Dynamically type:Dynamically typed programming language do type checking at run-time.
                          Example:Ruby,Python,Javascript etc..,
                          
                          
# What Scripting-Language vs Programming Language

  <>Programming-Language:(1):A programming language is a computer language that is used to communicate with computers using a set of instructions.
                        (2):It is compiled language or compiler-based language.
                        (3):It is used to develop an application or software.
                        (4):It runs or executes independently and does not depend on parent program.
                        (5):It uses a complier to convert source code into machine code.
                        (6):Examples:C,C++,Java etc..,
                        
                        
  <>Scripting-Language:(1):A scripting language is a type of programming language designed for a runtime system to automate the execution of tasks.
                       (2):It is interpreted language or interpreter-based language
                       (3):It is used to combine existing components and automate a specific task.
                       (4):It runs or executes inside another program.
                       (5):It uses an interpreter to convert source code into machine code.
                       (6):Examples:Ruby,Python,Javascript et..,
